Kind Employee Humble About Good Deed  
善行について謙虚な従業員

> `deed`「行動」  
> Magic: The gathering: Pernicious Deed / 破滅的な行為

Nineteen-year-old Joey Prusak from Hopkins, Minnesota, made the national news today with an act of kindness.  
ミネソタ州ホプキンス出身の19歳のJoey Prusakは、親切な行動で本日全国ニュースを発表しました。

While working in an ice cream store, he saw a visually-impaired man drop $20 out of his wallet.  
アイスクリーム店で働いている間、彼は視覚障害者が財布から20ドルを落とすのを見ました。

The woman lined up behind him picked up the money and slipped it into her own purse.  
彼の後ろに並んでいた女性はお金を拾い、自分の財布に入れました。

> `lineup`[名]「列」
> アイスクリーム屋で準備する→並ぶと意訳する  

Joey witnessed her selfish act and asked her politely to return the money.  
ジョーイは彼女の利己的な行為を目撃し、お金を返すように丁寧に彼女に頼みました。

The woman denied picking anything up, so Joey asked her to leave.  
女性は何かを拾うことを拒否したので、ジョーイは彼女に去るように頼みました。

He then gave the blind man $20 out of his own wallet and went back to work.  
それから彼は盲人に自分の財布から20ドルを渡して、仕事に戻りました。

Joey was too modest to mention the incident to his boss.  
ジョーイは控えめすぎて上司にその事件について話すことはできなかった。

> `modest`「謙虚な」  
> `modestly speaking`「控えめに言って」

But another customer was moved enough to report the story to the media.  
しかし、別の顧客は十分に感動し、その話をメディアに報告した。

Now, people are calling the store, thanking Joey and even offering him jobs.  
今、人々は店を呼び、ジョーイに感謝し、彼に仕事を提供しさえしています。

Customer traffic at the ice cream store has doubled, and many people are leaving large tips.  

Joey says he will donate the money to charity.

Hello, I'm Dr.John Sachs.  

I'm here to present the results of this year's UN World HAppiness Report.  

The report was created with the help of universities around the world.  

It ranks the happiness of 156 countries.  

This year, all of the top five happiest countries were in Northern Europe.  

Denmark took the top spot, followed by Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.  

Other countries in the top ten were Canada, Finland, Austria, Iceland, adn Australia.  

The most economically powerful countries were not necessarily the happiest.  

For example, the U.S. ranked 17th, and Japan was 43rd.  

The UN measures happiness by studying six key factors: incomes, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, freedom from corruption, social support, and generosity.  

The UN measures happiness because data shows that happy people live longer, earn more, are more productive, and are kinder and more generous to each other.  

one common feature of the happiest countries is fair sharing of wealth.  

All have governments with generous social welfare policies.  

These ask citizens to be generous with income tax.  

Not every culture supports high taxes and generous welfare.  

But in terms of happiness, Northern Europe has found a successful formula.

Interviewer:  
Today I'm talking with psychologist Sonia Davies, author of the book, _Increase Your Happiness_.  

The book is about all the things happy people do differently from unhappy people.  

Sonia, what are some things our viewer can do to increase their happiness?  

Sonia:  
Firstly, appreciate what you have right now, instead of wishing for things you don't have.  

I'm not only talking about possessions.  

You need to appreciate all the simple joys of everyday life.  

Be thankful for your health, and take care of your body.  

Appreciate your friends and family, and nurture those relationships.  

Interviewer:  
That sounds like good advice.  

What else should people do?  

Sonia:  
Develop an optimistic outlook.  

Believe that you can overcome challenges and solve problems.  

This will help you commit to your goals and achieve them.  

You will fail sometimes, but you can grow and learn from failure too.  

A positive attitude will give you the energy to make good things happen, and the strength to cope when things go wrong.  

Interviewer:  
I always try to believe things will turn out for the best.  

Do you have any other advice?  

Sonia:  
Yes.  

The happiest people are, above all, kind.  

Happiness and kindness are closely linked.  

In scientific studies, daily acts of kindness produce a steady increase in happiness.  

Kindness makes us, and the people we are kind to, feel good.  

Even witnesses to acts of kindness feel better.  

If you act kindly, others will also be kind to you in turn.  

In a very real sense, the kinder you are, the happier you can expect to feel.
