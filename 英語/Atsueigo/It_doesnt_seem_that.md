# seemのthat節

[【学校習ったのと違う？】thatの省略についてネイティブに聞いたら驚きの回答が| It doesn't seem that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N6wmxqPWpA)

## 出てきた表現

- It seems like it's going to rain.（丁寧度：低）  
  こりゃ、雨が降りそうだな
- It seems as if 〜（丁寧度：中）
- It seems as though 〜（丁寧度：高）
- It seems that 〜

## 肯定文のとき

"It seems that he is upset" versus "It seems he is upset"

It seems that he is upset.  
彼は怒ってるっぽい

誰かが、話者とは別の人のことを話題にするときに用いられる。

`that`がある方がしっくりくるようだが、`that`がなくてもnaturalに聞こえるらしい。  

## 否定文のとき

"It doesn't seem that he likes it" versus "It doesn't seem he likes it"

たとえば、パーティでチョコレートを手にしない友達Ａがいて、友達Ｂに次のようなことを言う。

It doesn't seem that he likes chocolate, does he?  
彼、チョコは好きじゃないの？

否定文の場合、`that`が省略されると不自然に聞こえるらしい。

"It doesn't seem he likes chocolate, does he?"は正しく聞こえないらしい。

It doesn't seems that he is A.は  
It doesn't seems for him to be A.と同じため、thatが落ちると不自然に思われるのだそう。

## Type Script

A: Today I've got a few questions.  

T: Yes fire away  

A: You don't have to give me the exact answer but what I'm expecting is your personal feeling about it.  

A:This is about a typical structure that native speakers often use but  

A: It seems like something.  

T: It seems like, okay, and then.  

A: And then, often a sentence comes after that, right?  

T: Yes. It seems like it's going to rain.  

A: Yes, correct  

A: So, 'it seems like' is a very typical structure and we all know that you know that's very often used and that's fine, so that's ticked off.

> `tick something off`「〜を終わらせる」

T: The question around it is  

A: there is another form similar to this without like  

T: It seems that sentence  

A: My question here is, is this 'that' necessary?  

T: You're asking if 'that' is necessary.  

A: Yeah so that's the very first question, 'that' is necessary or not.  

A: and the second question is like 'it seems that'  

A: Is structure common in the first place?  

A: Like do people actually use it seems ...  

T: People do, they use that in conversation.  

T: but I would say (it), I don't say 'it seems that', I say 'it seems as though'  

T: For example ... I'm trying to think of an example ...  

A: But 'it seems as though' sounds like already like 'it seems like' but sounds a little bit more formal.  

T: Yeah, it seems like, it seems as though  

A: How about 'it seems that'  

T: That is also common, that is used.  

T: Usually when talking about "It seems that he is upset" like you said earlier  

T: 'It seems that' - usually when talking about another person

T: Two people are having a conversation about a third party.

A: And how about "it seems he's upset"

T: I think 'it seems that' is more common. That's just on my personal experience

T: "It seems he's upset" versus "It seems that he's upset"  

T: That's a difficult one to tell

T: They're both correct, they are both correct. Either of them are grammatically incorrect

A: Right, does the latter sound a little bit unnatural or not really?

T: No that's natural too, that's perfect

A: That's natural too

T: Okay it just depends who's speaking and where they're from possibly

> `possible`「おそらく」

A: Without that it works, okay so that question, solved.

A: The next question, which is a little bit more juicy.

> `juicy`「深い」

A: When you say 'it doesn't seem'

A: For example "It doesn't seem he likes it"

T: It doesn't seem he likes it... No, that's incorrect.

A: It doesn't seem that he likes it, how about that?

A: The reason I was asking this question is my Australian friend told me that when you use 'it seems that' in the negative sentence, like 'it doesn't seem that', 'That' has to be there to make it sound natural.

T: If it's negative

A: If it's negative that has to be there

T: It doesn't seem that she is happy. It doesn't seem that ...

T: Yeah okay, I kind of agree but I would also say it doesn't seem as though

T: Okay so give me the situation and I will tell you how I would say it.

A: Let's imagine a situation where you give a piece of chocolate to your friend next to you

A: maybe in a party or something

A: and then, he didn't even touch it.

A: And you think that of this person actually doesn't like chocolate

A: Then you tell your friend next to you

A: "Oh it doesn't seem like he likes chocolate, does he?" or something like that

A: What would you say?

T: I would say that. It doesn't seems like he likes chocolate, does he?

T: but I'm not sure how correct it is

A: Yeah, so grammatically, I don't care. Lie I don't care about grammar

T: So, now you're going on to more natural, how people actually say it.

A: Exactly that's what I care.

A: So how you feel about it and that's more important than grammar rules, in my opinion

T: Yeah I would say to my friend "It doesn't seem like he likes that chocolate"

A: Yes, so that's what I would say as well

A: but is it okay to say for example

A: "It doesn't seem he likes chocolate, does he?"

T: No I would not say that

A: "It doesn't seem that he likes chocolate, does he?"

T: That's more, that's correct. I'd say 'that' before

A: See? That's the point

A: Yeah so that's what's making all the confusion

T: Who is the confusion with?

A: The confusion is that why 'that' has to be there in a negative sentence whereas 'that' doesn't have to be there in a positive sentence

> `whereas`「一方で」

T: I see what you're getting at
