# Try something new for 30 days

He try something new for 30 days in the footsteps of the great American philosopher Morgan Spurlock.

The idea is actually pretty simple.

Only think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days.

It turns out, 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract the habit.

There's a few things that he learned while doing these 30 day challenges.

The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable.

It seem that he try to take a picture everyday for a month.

And he remember exactly where he was and what he was doing that day.

He also noticed that he started to do more and harder 30 day challenges, his self-confidence grew.

Apparently, he went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work.

But, In just 30 days, taking pictures, writing novels, and biking can never be a professional.

when we made small, sustainable changes, things we could keep doing, they were more likely to stick.

He says "what are you waiting for?".

The next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not.

So why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot!
