Statement from David B. Burritt, U. S. Steel President and CEO,  on Today’s Order by President Biden 
Less Than a Minute Read

January 3, 2025 - President Biden’s action today is shameful and corrupt. He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company’s future, our workers, and our national security. He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk. The Chinese Communist Party leaders in Beijing are dancing in the streets. And Biden did it all while refusing to even meet with us to learn the facts.

Our employees and communities deserve better. We needed a President who knows how to get the best deal for America and work hard to make it happen. Make no mistake: this investment is what guarantees a great future for U. S. Steel, our employees, our communities, and our country. We intend to fight President Biden’s political corruption.
