# Unit3: Confidence in the Classroom

## Step1

South Korean students score high in exams but low in confidence.

In global exams, South Korean school students rank first in science and second in math.

But South Korean students are also among the least confident in their math and science abilities.

Last year 47 percent of Korean eighth-grade students achieved advanced scores in global math exams, compared with 7 percent of American eighth-graders.

However, in a survey of 300,000 students in 50 countries, South-korean students ranked 49th for confidence in their abilities, while U.S. students were number one.

## Step2

Good morning boys and girls.

Un today's class, we're going to discuss self-esteem.

Self-esteem is the way you think about yourself and the things you do.

Having high self-esteem means you feel proud of who you are and what you can do.

People with high self-esteem are comfortable about trying new things, and they expect good things to happen to them.

---

Having low self-esteem means you're not feeling good about who you are and what you can do.

People with low self-esteem may be afraid to try new things because they think they will fail.

They sometimes believe that others don't like them, or that they can't expect to make friends when they like someone.

---

Having high self-esteem gives you the courage to be yourself, without worrying what others think of you.

It's good idea to do things that boost your self-esteem, so right now I'd like you to try an exercise with me.

I want you yo take out a piece of paper and make a list of good things you remember others saying about you.

After that, add some good things you know about yourself.

You have ten minutes, so let's get started.

## Step3

I: You're on Student Radio SRUC.

We're talking today about the experience of foreign students studying here at the University of Chicago.

I have with me Kanae Matsuda, a psychology student from Japan.

Kanae, how are you enjoying your studies?

K: Well, I'm happy now, but it was a real culture shock when I first entered a U.S. high school 3 years ago.

I: really? What was different?

K: Everything: both the style of teaching and the way examinations are graded.

I: How does the style of teaching differ?

K: Teaches in Japan expect students to be quiet, and students rarely ask questions.

Japanese teachers write important information on the board, but American teachers often just talk and expect students to do research and write papers.

American teachers think class participation is important.

They require students to give opinions or ask questions.

They reward you for speaking up.

I: Japanese students don't ask questions?

K: Not so much. For the first few months I was in the U.S., I was nervous in classes because I wasn't confident about stating my opinions.

I: So what's different about exams?

K: Exams in Japan test exactly what you learned in class and textbooks, and they are usually multiple-choice tests.

In the U.S. you often have to write essays in exams.

I was shocked when I first got a C in American History.

My teacher said I was just repeating facts from class.

She wanted logical opinions supported by facts.

I: And do you like talking and arguing with teachers and other students now?

K: Yeah, it's fun. I like thinking about the reasons and facts behind my opinions.
