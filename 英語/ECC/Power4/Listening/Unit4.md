# Unit4: The Smartest Cities in the World

## Step1: Building the Future in Fujiisawa

Fujiisawa Sustainable Smart Town is a new project in the Japanese city of Fujisawa, about 50 km west of Tokyo.  

A group of nine companies, including Panasonic, is working together with a budget of 60 billion yen to create a model green ciy for the future.  

The 1,000 homes in Smart Town will cut average carbon dioxide emissions by 70%.

All the homes will have solar power generators and energy storage devices.

Other standard features include energy-saving hot-water systems and air conditioners, and sensor-controlled lighting.

The companies involved include architects, real estate developers, construction firms, and banks.

All see Smart Town as an opportunity to test out sustainable urban design technologies before marketing them worldwide.

## Step2

Hello, my name is David Wang, and I'm a spokesperson for Tianjin Eco-city in China.

Thank you for inviting me to speak at the International Urban Design Conference.

China is now home to 1.3 billion people.

More than half of these people now live in cities, and three quarters will live in cities by 2030.

This is consuming too much energy, and country is becoming polluted.

We urgently need to build sustainable cities and provide a healthy living environment for the future.

Tianjin Eco-city is the first such city to be built in China.

We had several goals in mind when designing the city.

One foal is to show how it's possible to clean up a polluted area and build an eco-city in its place.

The site of Tianjin was previously a dumping ground for industrial waste.

The soil and water were both very polluted.

Cleaning up the site took three years.

In the process, we developed a new technology for removing heavy metals from the water supply.
The other important goal is to make Tianjin a great place to live.

The other important goal is to make Tianjin a great place to live.

The advanced technology will provide an environmentally friendly home for 350,000 people.

There are walking and cycling paths everywhere, and parks every 300 meters.

And if this sounds like a place for only the wealthy, it's not.

Twenty percent of the housing is subsidized for low-wage workers and their families.

We want Tianjin to show the world that being green is an affordable way of life for everyone.

Interviewer:  
Today with me in the studio I have Paul Ranger, an expert on green urban design.

Paul, what is the biggest challenge we face when it comes to making out cities greener?

Paul:  
The big challenge is to make power-saving technologies standard everywhere, not just here and there.

Elevtric cars are one example.

A few electric cars in a few cities won't make much difference, but electric cars in every city would make a huge difference.

All cities should be using LED lights instead of regular bulbs.

We need more solar panels and wind turbines for clean power.

Interviewer:  
And what is being done to make sure this happens?

Paul:  
Major companies are investing billions of dollars in building eco-cities to develop test, and manufacture new technologies on a large scale.

Interviewer:  
What is currently being tested in these eco-cities?

Paul:  
Well, for example, Tianjin Eco-city in China draws on solar power, wind power, and thermal energy from the ground.
Wind turbines in the streets send power directly to buildings nearby.
