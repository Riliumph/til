Good morning staff.  
おはようスタッフ

Today, I'd like to talk about our corporate social responsibility program.  
本日は、企業の社会的責任プログラムについてお話したいと思います。

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for the high level of interest you've shown toward the Table for Two program.

It's been about a year since our company introduced 780-calorie TFT lunches to the cafeteria at this manufacturing plant.

So far, workers have purchased 6179 TFT lunches,

This means thousands of lunches have been distributed to African schools.

Your choice to eat a healthy lunch means a great deal to these children.

And I know many of us are also enjoying the benefits of consuming fewer calories.

---

Because the TFT cafeteria program has been so successful, we have decided to expand our involvement with the charity.

This week, Table for Two vending machines will be installed in the refreshment area at the east end of the manufacturing plant.

Each TFT vending machine has a TFT logo.

If you buy a low-calorie drink such as water or tea from a TFT machine, five cents from that sale will go toward the charity, which means we'll be helping even more children in developing counties.

If anyone has a new fund-raising idea for the TFT program, please contact Belinda Robertson on extension 4558.

Interviewer:  
Today I'm talking with Fumitugu Tosu, who ios helping Table for Two expand into the U.S.

Mr. Tosu, where did the idea for Table for Two come from?

Mr.Tosu:  
The idea originated at a 2006 World Economic Forum Conference.

There was a session where one group was trying to address obesity and another group was trying to tackle hunger.

We had the idea of tying these issues together.

Interviewer:  
Is the idea for Table for Two advertised in Japan the same way as it is in the U.S.?

Mr.Tosu:  
In the U.S., we put slightly more emphasis on obesity because it's a bigger problem here, and it's what makes our program stand out from other food charities.

Interviewer:  
How did Table for Two initially decide to operate in the U.S.?

Mr. Tosu:  
The U.S. is a natural choice.

The need is huge, with high rates of obesity, and the size of the market means a big potential impact on both hunger and obesity.

Interviewer:  
What are some of the challenges of the U.S. market that you didn't face in Japan?

Mr. Tosu:  
Most big nonprofits are based in the U.S., so it's harder to stand out from the crowd.

The U.S. is also geographically vast.

In Japan, most of our partners are in or near Tokyo, so we can hold regular meetings.

In the U.S. our operations are hundreds or thousand of miles apart, so they have to operate more independently.

Interviewer:  
What are some of Table for Two's new developments in the U.S.?

Mr. Tosu:  
We are partnering with a vending machine operator to have a third of their products be healthier alternatives.

A green dot will identify the healthy Table for Two products.

We are also launching Table for Two food trucks.

As long as we stick to our mission and the basic model, there are endless opportunities.
