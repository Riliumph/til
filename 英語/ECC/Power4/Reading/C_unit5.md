# Women Are the Real Technology Geeks

## Overview

There is a stereotype that a person who is always using the latest technology is traditionally **male**.  

> latest: state-of-the-artのこと

Technology companies employ relatively **fewer** women, and their marketing is mostly directed at **men**.  

But research indicates that women are now the **biggest** customers of new technology.  

Women buy **more** new devices than men.

They are the biggest users of phone services, messaging, GPS, and social networking.

**Women** choose most of the devices in family homes.

There are, therefore, clear business reasons why technology companies should be promoting **women** and marketing products toward women.
